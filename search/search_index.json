Before we even start talking about hypnosis, there are a few points we should cover.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#mental-health-and-hypnosis","title":"Mental Health and Hypnosis","text":"<p>Hypnosis is best enjoyed with a calm mind clear of any distractions. If you have a metal condition, consider asking your psychologist or doctor if hypnosis is right for you. Hypnosis can be espically dangerous if you have a multiple personality disorder or a dissociative identidy disorder.</p> <p>Before listening to hypnosis, you should do a bit of research about what you're about to listen to, and who created it. Vetting a file you're going to listen to is a very good practice to develop for new listeners. Once you get some experience with a creator and their files, then you can consider going in blind.</p> <p>Before listening to hypnosis, you should take care of any obligations, like cooking yourself a meal, hydrating yourself, going to the bathroom, or talking to a loved one.</p> <p>I have no experience with using substances with hypnosis. I would say that you shouldn't need anything to expierence hypnosis, but everyone is different.</p> <p>Remember, hypnosis can't make you do something that is absolutely against your moral code.  However, it can help unlock facets of your personality you didn't know you had.</p> <p>If you're not enjoying a file, you can turn it off at any time. It's easy for the mind to shut off a stimuli when feeling disgust. Like how you pinch your nose when you smell garbage, except it's you taking off your headset when you hear something you don't like.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#vocabulary","title":"Vocabulary","text":""},{"location":"Start/#trance","title":"Trance","text":"<p>A relaxed, yet sharply focused state of mind.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#neuro-linguistic-programming","title":"Neuro-Linguistic Programming","text":"<p>A form of communication that aims to change behavioral patterns, proven a pseudoscience though.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#fractionation","title":"Fractionation","text":"<p>The act of taking the subject out of trance, then dropping them back down deeper. </p>"},{"location":"Start/#storytelling","title":"Storytelling","text":"<p>The hypnotist weaves a story of a character that you can identify with, and potentially self insert into.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#subliminals","title":"Subliminals","text":"<p>Subliminals are things that the concious mind isn't supposed to pick up, and are designed to go straight to the subconcious mind.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#learning-to-trance","title":"Learning to trance","text":"<p>Before listening to hypnosis, you should learn to trance. Meditation is a great first step on learning to trance, as you're learning to just focus on your self and your breathing.</p> <p>Yoga can also be helpful while learning to trance. Most hypnosis files involve you staying stil for an extended period of time, which may lead to cramping. Getting a cramp while under and getting rudely pulled out of trance by something like a charlie horse is not an enjoyable experience. Stretching hypnosis will also improve blood flow. </p> <p>Doing breathing exercises is also beneficial.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#core-concepts-from-this-page","title":"Core concepts from this page","text":"<ul> <li>Stretch and relax before hypnosis.</li> <li>Take care of prior obligations before listening.</li> <li>Don't get discouraged if you don't see instant results.</li> <li>You can stop at anytime.</li> <li>Have Fun!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/","title":"Wishlist","text":"<p>Here are some files I'm on the lookout for.</p>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#goddess-athalia","title":"Goddess Athalia","text":"<ul> <li>The Man and the Sea</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#goddess-brianna-beretta","title":"Goddess Brianna Beretta","text":"<ul> <li>Hands-Free Orgasm Trigger Word Programming</li> <li>Gush: Hands-Free Premature Ejaculation</li> <li>Hands-Free Premature Ejaculation Mesmerization</li> <li>Twitch Streamer: Premature Ejaculation Mesmerizer</li> <li>Rocket: Deep PE and HFO Mind Programming</li> <li>Premie Acceptance Mindfuck: Cum Hands-Free or Else!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#foot-magic","title":"Foot Magic","text":"<ul> <li>Halloween Mesmerization</li> <li>Milking Game Training Loop</li> <li>You Are My Toy</li> <li>Extreme Mindwashing: The Milking Game pt 5</li> <li>DRONE SHUTDOWN: The Milking Game pt 6</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#priestess-katherin","title":"Priestess Katherin","text":"<ul> <li>The Hands-On Hands-Off Clinic 1 through 6</li> <li>Evil Sorceress Hands Free Orgasm</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#lady-draco","title":"Lady Draco","text":"<ul> <li>Hypno Blow</li> <li>Premie: Making you worse</li> </ul> <p>Updated 6-6-23</p>"}]}
