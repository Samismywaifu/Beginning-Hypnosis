Meditation is a great first step on learning to trance, as you're learning to just focus on your self and your breathing. Yoga can also be helpful while learning to trance. Most hypnosis files involve you staying still for an extended period of time, which may lead to cramping. Getting a cramp while under and getting rudely pulled out of trance by something like a charlie horse is not an enjoyable experience. Stretching hypnosis will also improve blood flow.  Doing breathing exercises is also beneficial.</p>"},{"location":"EH/#prepare-before-listening","title":"Prepare before listening","text":"<p>Before listening to a hypnosis file of your choice, there are a few things you should do to prepare. Be sure to take care of any obligations, like cooking yourself a meal, hydrating yourself, going to the bathroom, or talking to a loved one. Ensure that you won't be disturbed for the duration of the file, with an additional 5 minutes to refresh and reflect. Prepare a nice private space to sit or lay down, your bed, a comfortable chair, a hammock, whatever you feel is most comfortable for yourself. Remove any distractions from your surroundings, turn off your cellphone, or mute any notifications if you're using it to listen. If you'd like, you can also turn off the lights or wear a sleep mask. Remember, this time that you're setting aside is for YOU.</p>"},{"location":"EH/#seeing-results","title":"Seeing results","text":"<p>Hypnosis, like many things, requires practice and repetition. You may not always see instant results after listening to a file. In fact, most hypnosis recordings require multiple listens to install triggers that are used later. Sometimes, you may see results on the first listen, then no results on subsequent listens. It's completely fine to not see results as long as you're enjoying the experience you're having. Hypnosis is about the journey, not the destination. Some people don't see results. It may be just how their brains are wired. If you're one of those people, don't worry about it. If you're enjoying listening, that's good enough! Sometimes pretending that the results you want to see are already there helps. If you do have an end goal remember, listening to the hypnosis on a set schedule will help reach it.</p>"},{"location":"ELR/","title":"Early Listening Recommendations","text":"<p>Here I will list out some Hypnotists that I believe are fairly beginner-friendly, as well as file recommendations.</p>"},{"location":"ELR/#fiona-clearwater","title":"Fiona Clearwater","text":"<p>I'd highly recommend if you are brand new to hypnosis, you start with Fiona.

If you have a metal condition, consider asking your psychologist or doctor if hypnosis is right for you. Hypnosis can be especially dangerous if you have a multiple personality disorder or a dissociative identity disorder. Before listening to hypnosis, you should do a bit of research about what you're about to listen to, and who created it. Vetting a file you're going to listen to is a very good practice to develop for new listeners. Once you get some experience with a creator and their files, then you can consider going in blind. I have no experience with using substances with hypnosis. I would say that you shouldn't need anything to experience hypnosis, but everyone is different. Remember, hypnosis can't make you do something that is absolutely against your moral code.  However, it can help unlock facets of your personality you didn't know you had. If you're not enjoying a file, you can turn it off at any time. It's easy for the mind to shut off a stimuli when feeling disgust. Like how you pinch your nose when you smell garbage, except it's you taking off your headset when you hear something you don't like. If you're doing hypnosis in person, it is extremely important to set limits and expectations of what you will be doing. Trust is a very important aspect of hypnosis.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#vocabulary","title":"Vocabulary","text":""},{"location":"Start/#induction","title":"Induction","text":"<p>The very start of a hypnosis session, it is used to bring someone into a trance through various methods.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#trance","title":"Trance","text":"<p>A relaxed, yet sharply focused state of mind.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#neurolinguistic-programming","title":"Neurolinguistic Programming","text":"<p>A form of communication that aims to change behavioral patterns, proven a pseudoscience though.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#fractionation","title":"Fractionation","text":"<p>The act of taking the subject out of trance, then dropping them back down deeper. </p>"},{"location":"Start/#storytelling","title":"Storytelling","text":"<p>The hypnotist weaves a story of a character that you can identify with, and potentially self insert into.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#subliminals","title":"Subliminals","text":"<p>Subliminals are things that the conscious mind isn't supposed to pick up, and are designed to go straight to the subconscious mind.</p>"},{"location":"Start/#trigger","title":"Trigger","text":"<p>A trigger is a word, phrase, sound, or action that automatically invokes a feeling or action set while in trance. For example, if a hypnotist sets a trigger called drop, they then will then create an action or feeling that will occur every time you hear them say the word drop. A hypnotist may use the drop trigger to pull you deeper into a trance. A hypnotist may also tie a sound to the word, such as a finger snap, a bell, or a clicker. Thus, every time you would hear that sound, the trigger would activate. Some triggers can even be used outside of trance. Like the drop trigger, you and your hypnotist could just be relaxing on the couch, then they could snap their fingers and say drop, and you're pulled into trance.</p>"},{"location":"Wishlist/","title":"Wishlist","text":"<p>Here are some files I'm on the lookout for.</p>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#goddess-athalia","title":"Goddess Athalia","text":"<ul> <li>The Man and the Sea</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#goddess-brianna-beretta","title":"Goddess Brianna Beretta","text":"<ul> <li>Hands-Free Orgasm Trigger Word Programming</li> <li>Gush: Hands-Free Premature Ejaculation</li> <li>Hands-Free Premature Ejaculation Mesmerization</li> <li>Twitch Streamer: Premature Ejaculation Mesmerizer</li> <li>EJECT: Spontaneous Ejaculation Triggering</li> <li>Premie Acceptance Mindfuck: Cum Hands-Free or Else!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#foot-magic","title":"Foot Magic","text":"<ul> <li>Halloween Mesmerization</li> <li>Milking Game Training Loop</li> <li>You Are My Toy</li> <li>DRONE SHUTDOWN: The Milking Game pt 6</li> <li>MINDLESS DRONE: The Milking Game pt 7</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#priestess-katherin","title":"Priestess Katherin","text":"<ul> <li>The Hands-On Hands-Off Clinic 1 through 6</li> <li>Evil Sorceress Hands Free Orgasm</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wishlist/#lady-draco","title":"Lady Draco","text":"<ul> <li>Hypno Blow</li> <li>Premie: Making you worse</li> </ul>"}]}
