# Early Listening Recommendations

Here I will list out some Hypnotists that I believe are fairly beginner-friendly, as well as file recommendations.

## Fiona Clearwater
I'd highly recommend if you are brand new to hypnosis, you start with Fiona. She lays out what to expect at the start of each of her files, so you're not blindsided by anything.

#### Extra Deep Hypnosis With Fiona Clearwater
This file is designed to take you into a very deep trance and make it easier for you to go into deep trances in the future.

#### Clicker Fractionation Hypnosis
In this file Fiona uses a clicker to trigger you to go in and out of hypnosis.   

## Nikki Fatale
I've not had a chance to listen to many of her files, but from my research her files are very friendly to newcomers

#### Because series
This series is focused on going into a deep trance.

## Focused Relaxation
Fun little videos designed to help you relax into a trance, very safe for beginners. The videos are typically focused around a part of her body or an object. I don't have any specific recommendations for her flies, as they're all good starting points. If you're struggling to pick one to start with, I'd recommend one that has an induction.
