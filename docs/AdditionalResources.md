## Erotic Hypnosis Subreddit 
[The Erotic Hypnosis Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EroticHypnosis/) is a good community to explore, it has many members who actively create scripts and shorter erotic hypnosis files.

## Gone Wild Audio Subreddit
[The Gone Wild Audio Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoneWildAudio/ )is like the Erotic Hypnosis Subreddit, but a bit kinkier. I would say the audios are less geared towards hypnosis though.
