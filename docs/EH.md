# Enjoying Hypnosis

## Learning to trance
Before listening to hypnosis, you should learn to trance. Meditation is a great first step on learning to trance, as you're learning to just focus on your self and your breathing.
Yoga can also be helpful while learning to trance. Most hypnosis files involve you staying still for an extended period of time, which may lead to cramping. Getting a cramp while under and getting rudely pulled out of trance by something like a charlie horse is not an enjoyable experience. Stretching hypnosis will also improve blood flow. 
Doing breathing exercises is also beneficial.

## Prepare before listening
Before listening to a hypnosis file of your choice, there are a few things you should do to prepare. Be sure to take care of any obligations, like cooking yourself a meal, hydrating yourself, going to the bathroom, or talking to a loved one.
Ensure that you won't be disturbed for the duration of the file, with an additional 5 minutes to refresh and reflect.
Prepare a nice private space to sit or lay down, your bed, a comfortable chair, a hammock, whatever you feel is most comfortable for yourself.
Remove any distractions from your surroundings, turn off your cellphone, or mute any notifications if you're using it to listen. If you'd like, you can also turn off the lights or wear a sleep mask.
Remember, this time that you're setting aside is for YOU.

## Seeing results
Hypnosis, like many things, requires practice and repetition. You may not always see instant results after listening to a file. In fact, most hypnosis recordings require multiple listens to install triggers that are used later.
Sometimes, you may see results on the first listen, then no results on subsequent listens.
It's completely fine to not see results as long as you're enjoying the experience you're having. Hypnosis is about the journey, not the destination.
Some people don't see results. It may be just how their brains are wired. If you're one of those people, don't worry about it. If you're enjoying listening, that's good enough!
Sometimes pretending that the results you want to see are already there helps.
If you do have an end goal remember, listening to the hypnosis on a set schedule will help reach it.
