# Hypnosis and You

Welcome to the guide! Before we even start talking about hypnosis, there are a few points we should cover.

## Mental Health and Hypnosis
Hypnosis is best enjoyed with a calm mind clear of any distractions. If you have a metal condition, consider asking your psychologist or doctor if hypnosis is right for you. Hypnosis can be especially dangerous if you have a multiple personality disorder or a dissociative identity disorder.
Before listening to hypnosis, you should do a bit of research about what you're about to listen to, and who created it. Vetting a file you're going to listen to is a very good practice to develop for new listeners. Once you get some experience with a creator and their files, then you can consider going in blind.
I have no experience with using substances with hypnosis. I would say that you shouldn't need anything to experience hypnosis, but everyone is different.
Remember, hypnosis can't make you do something that is absolutely against your moral code. 
However, it can help unlock facets of your personality you didn't know you had.
If you're not enjoying a file, you can turn it off at any time. It's easy for the mind to shut off a stimuli when feeling disgust. Like how you pinch your nose when you smell garbage, except it's you taking off your headset when you hear something you don't like.
If you're doing hypnosis in person, it is extremely important to set limits and expectations of what you will be doing. Trust is a very important aspect of hypnosis.

## Vocabulary

### Induction
The very start of a hypnosis session, it is used to bring someone into a trance through various methods.

### Trance
A relaxed, yet sharply focused state of mind.

### Neurolinguistic Programming
A form of communication that aims to change behavioral patterns, proven a pseudoscience though.

### Fractionation
The act of taking the subject out of trance, then dropping them back down deeper. 

### Storytelling
The hypnotist weaves a story of a character that you can identify with, and potentially self insert into.

### Subliminals
Subliminals are things that the conscious mind isn't supposed to pick up, and are designed to go straight to the subconscious mind.

### Trigger
A trigger is a word, phrase, sound, or action that automatically invokes a feeling or action set while in trance. For example, if a hypnotist sets a trigger called drop, they then will then create an action or feeling that will occur every time you hear them say the word drop. A hypnotist may use the drop trigger to pull you deeper into a trance. A hypnotist may also tie a sound to the word, such as a finger snap, a bell, or a clicker. Thus, every time you would hear that sound, the trigger would activate.
Some triggers can even be used outside of trance. Like the drop trigger, you and your hypnotist could just be relaxing on the couch, then they could snap their fingers and say drop, and you're pulled into trance.
