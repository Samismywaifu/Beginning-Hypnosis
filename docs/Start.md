# Hypnosis and You

Welcome to the guide! Before we even start talking about hypnosis, there are a few points we should cover.

## Mental Health and Hypnosis
Hypnosis is best enjoyed with a calm mind clear of any distractions. If you have a metal condition, consider asking your psychologist or doctor if hypnosis is right for you. Hypnosis can be espically dangerous if you have a multiple personality disorder or a dissociative identidy disorder.

Before listening to hypnosis, you should do a bit of research about what you're about to listen to, and who created it. Vetting a file you're going to listen to is a very good practice to develop for new listeners. Once you get some experience with a creator and their files, then you can consider going in blind.

Before listening to hypnosis, you should take care of any obligations, like cooking yourself a meal, hydrating yourself, going to the bathroom, or talking to a loved one.

I have no experience with using substances with hypnosis. I would say that you shouldn't need anything to expierence hypnosis, but everyone is different.

Remember, hypnosis can't make you do something that is absolutely against your moral code. 
However, it can help unlock facets of your personality you didn't know you had.

If you're not enjoying a file, you can turn it off at any time. It's easy for the mind to shut off a stimuli when feeling disgust. Like how you pinch your nose when you smell garbage, except it's you taking off your headset when you hear something you don't like.

## Vocabulary
### Trance
A relaxed, yet sharply focused state of mind.

### Neuro-Linguistic Programming
A form of communication that aims to change behavioral patterns, proven a pseudoscience though.

### Fractionation
The act of taking the subject out of trance, then dropping them back down deeper. 

### Storytelling
The hypnotist weaves a story of a character that you can identify with, and potentially self insert into.

### Subliminals
Subliminals are things that the concious mind isn't supposed to pick up, and are designed to go straight to the subconcious mind.


## Learning to trance
Before listening to hypnosis, you should learn to trance. Meditation is a great first step on learning to trance, as you're learning to just focus on your self and your breathing.

Yoga can also be helpful while learning to trance. Most hypnosis files involve you staying stil for an extended period of time, which may lead to cramping. Getting a cramp while under and getting rudely pulled out of trance by something like a charlie horse is not an enjoyable experience. Stretching hypnosis will also improve blood flow. 

Doing breathing exercises is also beneficial.
